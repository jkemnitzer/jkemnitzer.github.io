I’m Jonas Kemnitzer, a research associate at the Institute for Information Systems (iisys) in Hof, Germany, and a PhD candidate focused on developing secure LLM architectures grounded in the transformer model. My work combines deep technical expertise in large language models with applied robotics and real-world AI systems.

Previously, I worked as an AI Prototype Engineer at IBM, where I built and tested cutting-edge AI applications with a focus on robustness and scalability. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of language model security, efficient inference, and autonomous systems—especially how transformer-based models can be hardened against emerging threats like prompt injection.

Outside of academic research, I actively prototype and experiment with robotics platforms and like to explore embodied AI. My goal is to bridge foundational LLM research with practical, hardware-integrated applications.
