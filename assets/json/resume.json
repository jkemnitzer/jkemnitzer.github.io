Therefore we combine a modified stable diffusion model with inpainting techniques and incorporated constraints. We introduce a prototype which allows users to upload a photo and visualize a more fit version of themselves. We evaluated our approach in various experiments and focused on the applicability and effectiveness of these techniques, with attention to gender-specific results.",
