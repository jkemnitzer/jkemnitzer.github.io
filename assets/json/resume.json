Therefore we combine a modified stable diffusion model with inpainting techniques and incorporated constraints. We introduce a prototype which allows users to upload a photo and visualize a more fit version of themselves. We evaluated our approach in various experiments and focused on the applicability and effectiveness of these techniques, with attention to gender-specific results.","icon":"fa-solid fa-book"}],"skills":[{"name":"Machine Learning","level":"Advanced","icon":"fa-solid fa-brain","keywords":["Supervised Learning","Unsupervised Learning","Scikit-learn","Model Evaluation","Data Preprocessing"]},{"name":"Deep Learning","level":"Advanced","icon":"fa-solid fa-microchip","keywords":["Transformer Architectures","LLM Security","Prompt Injection Mitigation","PyTorch","TensorFlow","Fine-tuning","CNNs","RNNs"]},{"name":"Robotics","level":"Advanced","icon":"fa-solid fa-warehouse","keywords":["Quadruped Robotics (Unitree)","Self-driving Vehicles","Sensor Integration","Real-time Systems"]},{"name":"Software Engineering","level":"Intermediate","icon":"fa-solid fa-code","keywords":["Prototyping","Agile Development","Flutter (UI Prototyping)","Git","CI/CD Basics"]},{"name":"Programming Languages","level":"Advanced","icon":"fa-solid fa-terminal","keywords":["Python","C++","Dart","LaTeX","Bash"]}],"languages":[{"language":"German","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Korean","fluency":"Conversational","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Physics","icon":"fa-solid fa-atom","keywords":["Classical Mechanics","Electromagnetism","Relativity","Scientific Curiosity"]},{"name":"Sustainability","icon":"fa-solid fa-leaf","keywords":["Climate Neutrality","Green Technology","Sustainable Systems","Responsible Innovation"]},{"name":"Game Development","icon":"fa-solid fa-gamepad","keywords":["Pixel Art Games","Medieval Strategy","Unreal Engine","Prototyping","Indie Game Design"]}],"projects":[{"name":"Quantum Computing","summary":"Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation.
